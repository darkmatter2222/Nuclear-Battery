# Ryan Susman's Nuclear Battery Project 

# Objective:  
Build an energy harvester to collect latient energy from tritium vials.  
I have a deep belief that this latent energy if captured efficiently and properly harvested can be put to good use.  I understand that solar cells are incredibly inefficient and may things that Iâ€™m doing here are not perfect. This repo is to only explore the science.  
Maybe the next person can learn from this repo and my research and improve.
