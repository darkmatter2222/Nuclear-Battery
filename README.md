# Ryan Susman's Nuclear Battery Project 

# Objective:  
Build an energy harvester to collect latient energy from tritium vials.  
I have a deep belief that this latent energy if captured efficiently and properly harvested can be put to good use.  I understand that solar cells are incredibly inefficient and may things that Iâ€™m doing here are not perfect. This repo is to only explore the science.  
Maybe the next person can learn from this repo and my research and improve.

# Science   
[Photovoltaics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics) and [Betavoltaics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betavoltaic_device), what we are building is much safer version of [this](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1511/1511.07427.pdf) where instead of using Isotopes of promethium, we are using tritium an isotope of hydrogen, a beta particle emitter.
