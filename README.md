# Science   
[Photovoltaics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics) and [Betavoltaics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betavoltaic_device), what we are building is much safer version of [this](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1511/1511.07427.pdf) where instead of using Isotopes of promethium, we are using tritium an isotope of hydrogen, a beta particle emitter.
