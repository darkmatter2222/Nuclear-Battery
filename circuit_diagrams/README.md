# Ryan Susman's Nuclear Battery Project 

# Measurement Techniques

## Objective
Find reliable methods to measure the performance of individual aspects of this project.

## Individual Tritium Cell Performance 
Leveraging a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and a 16 Bit ADC, I can perform endurance measurements on each tritium cell.   
Amazon: [Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=raspberry+pi+3+b%2B)  
Amazon: [16 Bits ADS1115 ADC Analog to Digital Module for Raspberry Pi 3/2/B+](https://www.amazon.com/ADS1115-Analog-Digital-Module-Raspberry/dp/B07GGY7WX7)  
  
I found this for be consistently more accurate and significantly cheaper than a python enabled FLUKE multimeter.  

Using this approach, I can execute 24+ hour endurance testing where we charge a capacitor and discharge a capacitor repeatedly. By doing this we can reliably measure and improve each tritium cell to be peak performance.
